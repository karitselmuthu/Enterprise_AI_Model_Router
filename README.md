# Enterprise AI Model Router

Enterprises often send every AI request to the same large model, even when a
smaller, cheaper model could complete the task. This can increase cost, latency,
and data exposure. The goal of this project is a policy-aware router that
classifies requests, selects a model, validates results, and escalates when
needed.

Phase 1 provides a runnable API foundation. Callers currently choose a category
explicitly, and all four providers are deterministic mocks.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the API schema. Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/infer \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"category":"SLM","prompt":"Classify a Kubernetes pod restart alert"}'
```

Run tests with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q`.

`configs/models.yaml` defines the model ID for each of `SLM`, `LLM`, `LRM`,
and `VLM`. Set `ROUTER_MODELS_CONFIG` to load a different YAML file. In Phase 1,
only `provider: mock` is accepted. The VLM mock accepts text prompts but does
not ingest images. Invalid configuration prevents startup.

The [Phase 1 specification](docs/phase-1-spec.md) defines the current scope.
Later phases add policy-driven routing, live providers, evaluation, governance,
and deployment.
